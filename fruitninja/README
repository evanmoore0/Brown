Handin: This is my final handin

Overview:
    I created a game class that extends CS15Game, and is instantiated in the App.java class. When the frame for the game
    is created I create a new instance of the game class, and call add game on the frame and pass it the instance of the
    game class. The game class creates instances of the fruits, blade, and bomb classes. Then with these instances I use
    the onBladeContact() and launchItem() methods to incorporate the game functionality. All of the choppable items
    implement the Choppable interface which contains the chop() method. The chop() method is implemented differently in
    each of the fruit classes because they each have to return different point values, and the bomb class calls the
    explode method when the chop() method is called.

Design Choices:
    Some notable design choices I made was the choppable interface, class for each fruit, and using a switch statement
    in launchItem(). I decided to make an interface for all of the items that can be chopped by the fruit to easily
    allow me to call the chop() method on an instance of the interface. This cleaned up my code very nicely. I also
    decided to create a class for each fruit because they all needed to return a different string path in the getImage()
    method. Finally, in order to throw up a random item I used a switch statement and compared the cases in my switch
    statement to a random integer I create.

Known Bugs:
    At first I tried using if statements in the onBladeContact() method which worked at first, but after cutting a
    couple of the fruit it would only allow me to cut certain fruit.

Hours: This took me about 5 hours
