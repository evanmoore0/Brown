Doodlejump README

Handin: This is my final handin.

Overview:
    My doodlejump has five classes total. The App class contains an instance of the PaneOrganizer class which contains
    an instance of my Handler class. My Handler class contains an instance of both my Doodle and Platform class. My
    Handle class contains all of the logic and functionality for doodlejump, while my Doodle and Platform classes setup
    the doodle and platforms for the game.

Design Choices:
    One design choice I decided to make was to create an interects() method that checks to see if each platform in the
    my array list of platform intersects with doodle. I decided to make it like this because it seemed like the more
    efficient option to me. Another design choice I made was to factor out all of the code I had in my handle method in
    the GravityHandler class into methods. This made it very easy for me problem solve bugs, and it looks much nicer. I
    also used for loops instead of foreach loops because it helped me visualize what would occur when the code runs.

Known Bugs:
    An error I ran into a couple times occurred when I would try to add the same item to a pane multiple times. This made
     it tricky to update the labels how I wanted to.

Hours: This project took me approximately 14 hours to complete.

Extra Credit:
    I implemented a score counter that gives the user points based on how many platforms they jump on. I decided to
    implement this because the game didn't feel right without a scoreboard.
