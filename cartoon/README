Cartoon README

Handin: This is my final handin.

Overview:
I have five classes total: Cartoon- contains the timelines, eventhandlers, and label; CartoonHandler- creates the
composite shape, and methods that add functionality to the composite shape; PaneOrganizer- creates the borderpane and
the panes that will go onto the borderPane; Constants- contains all of my constant variables; App- creates the scene
and runs the app. The cartoon class accepts two variables, rocketPane and label, and creates an instance of
CartoonHandler. It also calls the timelines in order which animates the app. The PaneOrganizer class creates an instance
of the cartoon class and adds the panes to the top and middle of the borderpane.

Design Choices:
I decided to keep all of my shapes in the same class because it allowed me to easily position and create methods for the
cartoon as a whole. All of my EventHandlers/Timelines are connected. When you first run the program the StartLaunch
EventHandler waits until the user presses the space bar, then calls the setupLabelTimeline() which begins the countdown.
Once the countdown has reached zero the two remaining timelines are called, one moves the rocket, and the other updates
the label. I also added a secret message that appears after the spacecraft has traveled more than 100 miles, and
disappears after the spacecraft has traveled more than 120 miles. I put the button and button event handler in the
CartoonHandler class because I wanted it to appear on the bottom right corner of the screen. Originally the user could
press space bar as many times as they want causing the countDown to go into the negatives and the spacecraft to move
very quickly, but I added some logic in the StartLaunch() event handler to prevent this from happening.

Known Bugs:
If I let the cartoon run for a long time it begins to get very laggy and ends up crashing.

Why?:
I chose to make this space themed cartoon because space is my greatest interest. Ever since I was a little kid the vast
pit of absolutely incredible phenomena has peaked my curiosity. My single goal before I die is to go into space, and the
mere thought of entering space and seeing Earth below me makes me excited. Hopefully space travel will be commercialised
in the near future and it will be possible to make this ongoing dream of mine become reality. I have also already began
looking into the space force.

Hours: This project took me about 16 hours
